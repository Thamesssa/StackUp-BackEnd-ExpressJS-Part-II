# MERN Stack Blog Application

## Introduction

This is a mock blog application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The application is structured to have a clear separation of concerns with routes and logic categorized into separate files based on their specific functionality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm
- MongoDB

### Setting Up Your Workspace

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the root folder of your project.
2. Run the following commands to create a new directory and install the necessary packages:

```bash
mkdir routes-controllers
cd routes-controllers
npm install express morgan body-parser

Public Folder
Create a new folder called public in your project folder. This folder will be used to store files that can be accessible to the public. Within this folder, create a new file called public.txt and add the following text to the file: This is made public intentionally.

app.js
Create a new file app.js in the routes-controllers folder. This is the entry file for the backend application. Add the necessary code to set up your Express server, define routes and middleware, and handle errors.

Routes
Create a new folder called routes within your project folder. In this step, create 3 new route files, one for each primary route: authHandling.js, blogHandling.js, and userHandling.js. Each file represents the subroutes that belong to the primary route.

Running the Application
To start the server, run the following command in your terminal:

node app.js

Your server will start and listen for incoming requests on the port you specified in your app.js file.
